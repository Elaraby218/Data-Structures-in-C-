# [Linked list](https://github.com/Elaraby218/Data-Structures-in-C-/tree/main/linked_list) 

i implemented two types of linked list in this ( ordered linked list , unordered linkedlist)
the main difference between is ordered linked list is sorted (in my implementation sorted in ascending order ) but, unordered linked list is not sorted 

In the beginning, I collected all the common functions between the ordered linked list and the unordered linked list, and I created a parent class called "linked list type." Then, I derived the ordered linked list class and the unordered linked list class from it. The difference between them lies in the way they receive data or perform searches.

One of the basic operations performed on a list is to process each node of the list. This
requires the list to be traversed starting at the first node. Moreover, a specific application requires each node to be processed in a very specific way. A common technique to accomplish this is to provide an iterator.
